# The values below can reference variables used in the build.xml file for the project being analyzed (e.g., variables like ${build} can be used).

# This can be an absolute or a relative (e.g., iReports/)

# This _must_ be report/ for now; it is hard coded in the dynamic trace writer
# 		report/static/ will contain the static traces
#		report/dynamic/ will contain the dynamic traces

### STATIC SETTINGS
###

# Location of the _compiled_ source files.
inconsistency.static.src=${classes.dir}

# Location of the _compiled_ test files.
#	Note: If this is the same as the source files, just repeat the source file value, do not leave it blank.
inconsistency.static.test=${testclasses.dir}

### DYNAMIC SETTINGS (static settings required as well for dynamic tracing)
###

# This is the classpath id used in the build.xml file for your project
inconsistency.classpath=test-classpath

# This is the aspect list file; the file points to the tracer aspect to use.
# If the system you're tracing is not in the examples/ directory, you should
# copy the aspect.lst file from inconsistency.home, put it in your project's
# directory, and modify it to point to your modified copy of Tracer.aj.
inconsistency.aspect.lst=${inconsistency.home}/examples/voldemort/aspect.lst
